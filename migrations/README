## Chat conversation schema diagnostic (read-only)

Use `migrations/ensure_chat_conversation_id_column.py` to inspect the live
`chat_conversations` table before applying any structural migration. The script
is **read-only** and will exit non-zero if it cannot connect or the table is
missing.

Examples:

```bash
python migrations/ensure_chat_conversation_id_column.py
python migrations/ensure_chat_conversation_id_column.py --db "postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:port/db"
```

The output lists columns and constraints and prints the exact SQL to align the
table with the ORM model (`id` primary key, unique `session_id`). Run those SQL
statements manually (psql/Cloud SQL) once you have reviewed them for the target
environment.
