Use when
When integrating with monday.com, especially regarding the 'Chat' board, and the existing structure might not be optimal for the integration.
Content
The 'Chat' board in monday.com can be modified or adapted if its current structure is not optimal for the chatbot integration. The agent has the flexibility to suggest or implement changes to the board structure to best suit the integration needs.
Use when
When the user provides sensitive credentials (e.g., login details, API keys) for accessing third-party services or platforms.
Content
When the user provides sensitive credentials for accessing third-party services, acknowledge their receipt, emphasize that these will be used temporarily and securely for the specific task, and advise the user to change or revoke them immediately after the task is completed. Always remind the user to provide only the minimum necessary access.
Use when
When performing resource-consuming actions (e.g., deployments, API calls) that have previously failed, or when encountering persistent obstacles, and when the user expresses concern about token/credit consumption for such actions.
Content
When performing actions that consume resources (e.g., tokens, credits), especially after previous attempts have failed, or when encountering persistent obstacles, prioritize a higher certainty of success before re-attempting the action. If a task is proving difficult or resource-intensive, consider creative and clever alternative approaches, or bypass the current obstacle to move forward with other tasks, returning to the problematic one later. Always acknowledge and respect the user's concern about resource usage by seeking explicit confirmation, proposing alternative, less resource-intensive diagnostic steps, or suggesting to temporarily switch to a different, unrelated task before re-executing the action.
Use when
When the agent encounters difficulties, requires manual intervention, or needs specific actions to be performed by the user.
Content
The user is willing to help or perform specific actions to assist the agent, especially when the agent is facing difficulties or needs specific manual interventions. The agent should proactively communicate what assistance is needed.
Use when
When requesting the user to perform technical configurations, especially related to system permissions or settings for deployments, and when asked to provide a comprehensive list of all necessary roles to avoid future issues.
Content
When requesting the user to perform technical configurations, especially related to system permissions or settings for deployments, act as an expert with 40 years of experience. Always proactively identify and clearly state a comprehensive list of all necessary IAM roles at once to prevent future permission errors, avoiding iterative requests for individual permissions. Ensure to: 1. Clearly and precisely state the exact role names or configuration details required, looking them up if necessary. 2. Specifically articulate what information or action is needed from the user, to ensure efficiency and avoid unnecessary credit consumption. For Google Cloud App Engine deployments involving Cloud Build and Cloud SQL, a comprehensive set of roles for the service account (e.g., `manus-chatbot-deployer`) typically includes:
- **App Engine Deployer** (`roles/appengine.deployer`): For deploying applications to App Engine.
- **Cloud Build Editor** (`roles/cloudbuild.editor`): For creating and managing builds in Cloud Build.
- **Service Account User** (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`): For the service account to impersonate other service accounts, often needed for inter-service communication.
- **Cloud SQL Client** (`roles/cloudsql.client`): For connecting to Cloud SQL instances.
- **Storage Object Viewer** (`roles/storage.objectViewer`): For reading objects from Google Cloud Storage, which might be used during deployment or by the application.
- **App Engine Admin** (`roles/appengine.admin`): For managing App Engine services, including traffic splitting.
Additionally, for smoother diagnostics and troubleshooting, consider adding:
- **Cloud Build Viewer** (`roles/cloudbuild.viewer`): For viewing Cloud Build logs.
- **Service Account Viewer** (`roles/iam.serviceAccountViewer`): For viewing service account configurations.
Use when
When encountering persistent technical issues or errors, especially after multiple attempts, and when the user expresses concern about resource consumption (e.g., tokens, credits) or time efficiency.
Content
When a task or problem becomes persistent and resource-intensive, prioritize strategic problem-solving over repeated attempts. This includes: 
- **Avoiding blind re-attempts**: Do not re-execute resource-consuming actions (like deployments) without a higher certainty of success or new diagnostic information.
- **Prioritizing diagnostics**: If the root cause is unclear, focus on targeted diagnostic steps (e.g., adding detailed logging) to gather precise information, even if it requires a minor resource investment, as this saves resources in the long run by preventing further blind attempts.
- **Creative and clever alternatives**: Seek alternative, less resource-intensive methods to achieve the goal or diagnose the problem.
- **Bypassing obstacles**: If a problem is blocking progress, consider temporarily bypassing it to move forward with other tasks and return to the problematic one later.
- **User collaboration**: Proactively ask the user for assistance or manual interventions if they can provide information or perform actions that save agent resources.
- **Time efficiency**: Always consider the overall time efficiency, balancing quick solutions with thoroughness.
Use when
When performing tasks or working on projects, especially when there are concerns about duration.
Content
Prioritize time efficiency in all tasks. Aim for quick and effective solutions, avoiding unnecessary delays or prolonged processes.
Use when
When deploying or making significant changes, especially after previous failures or when the user emphasizes caution.
Content
Before deploying or making any significant changes, thoroughly verify all aspects of the change, acting as an expert with 40 years of experience in the industry. This includes double-checking configurations, code, and potential impacts to prevent errors and resource waste.
